Tokenomics
There will be a fixed supply of HPLUS - 21 million. The 21 million will be minted at the initial token generation event (TGE) with no further tokens to be created afterward. The token allocations are shown below:

30%   Presale and Public Sale
20%   Platform Development 
10%.  Team
10%.  Operations
10%   Strategic/Exchanges
10%   Marketing and Partnerships
5%     Bounties and Promotions
5%     Legal and Advisors

## Basically a fork of Statera, you will only need to tweak it a bit and add a 2% transaction tax instead of the 1% they have on theirs

## Lastly for the 2% burn, 1% of it will go to a market making wallet to be used to provide market trading support. Only 1% gets burnt completely

Should Transaction tax be applicable when:
1. Owner transfers tokens to AnyOne Anyone
2. AnyOne to Owner
3. Contract to Anyone
